4. Add the .gitignore file:
```bash
nano .gitignore
# Paste the contents from the artifact above
# Save and exit (Ctrl+X, then Y, then Enter)
```

5. Stage all your project files:
```bash
git add .
```

6. Commit the files:
```bash
git commit -m "Initial commit: Project setup"
```

7. Link to your remote repository:
```bash
git remote add origin <your-repository-url>
```
Replace `<your-repository-url>` with the URL of your Git repository (either HTTPS or SSH)

8. Push your project to the remote repository:
```bash
git push -u origin main
# Or if your default branch is named 'master':
# git push -u origin master
```

Troubleshooting tips:
- If you're having issues with the remote repository, double-check:
  1. The repository URL is correct
  2. You have the necessary permissions
  3. You're authenticated (for private repositories)

- If you accidentally added files you don't want, you can:
  - Remove a specific file from staging: `git reset HEAD <filename>`
  - Unstage all files: `git reset`

- If you want to see what files will be added:
```bash
git status
```

Do you need help with any of these steps? Do you know the exact URL of your remote repository, or do you need guidance on creating one?
